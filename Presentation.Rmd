# Introduction

### Did you know countries are ranked each year based on a Happiness Index?

.content-box-green[ 
Countries are ranked each year based on a **Happiness Index**. This index rates the happiness of countries on a scale from 0 to 10, and it’s pretty fascinating!

## Which Region looks the happiest?

* We have collected happiness data from World Happiness Report for 2020. It has global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be.<br>

* The group determined that the **“happiest”** countries were located in **Western Europe**, particularly Finland and Denmark.<br>
* Meanwhile the **“least happiest”** countries were located in **Sub-Saharan Africa** and **South Asia**.

**In High GDP Regions:**

- Counties in most regions, they are with either high GDP and high Ladder Score or low GDP and low Ladder Scores.

- In Central and Eastern Europe and Middle East and North Africa, some countries got high GDP scores but low Ladder Scores.

- In Latin America and Caribbean, some countries even their GDP are low but have high Ladder Scores.

**In Low GDP Regions:**

- In above low GDP countries, most are low GDP and low Ladder Scores.

- We nearly found no country has low Social Support score but got high Ladder Score. 

- In North America and ANZ, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Middle East and North Africa and Western Europe, Social Support and Ladder Score is more like positive correlation.

- In other Region, it doesn't show clear relationship between Social Support and Ladder Score.

**In High Healthy Life Expectancy Score Regions:**

- In the high Healthy Life Expectancy score countries group, it shows a positive correlation in Southeast Asia, Middle East and North Africa and North America and ANZ. 

- In the Commonwealth of Independent States, Central and Eastern Europe, Western Europe, some countries are almost at the same level of Healthy life Expectancy, their Ladder Scores arrange from a big difference.

**In Low Healthy Life Expectancy Score Regions:**

- They also have a low Ladder Score, while they don't look have a special relationship between Healthy Life Expectancy and Ladder Score.

* We observe that the countries with highest happiness score have a better GDP, less corruption, more freedom to make choices, good health ratio, more generosity and receive social support.

**Happiness Score for Countries**

The WHR calculates how much of the Happiness Index can be explained by the key factors. Add them all up and you should get close to the actual number. <br>

```{r map, fig.width=10, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
fig <- plot_ly(happiness, type='choropleth', locations= happiness$iso3 , z= happiness$happiness_score, text= ~paste(
                      "<br><b>Country:</b> ", country_name,
                      "<br><b>Happiness rank:</b>", happiness_rank), colorscale="Viridis")
fig <- fig %>% colorbar(title = "Happiness Score" )
fig <- fig %>% layout(
    title = 'World Happiness Map, Year 2020')
fig
```
